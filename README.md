# Calion Crafting Shop. 
## Description 

This project is an **e-commerce** mock up. Built as a way of practicing and showcasing programming skills as well as to be used as a template for future similar projects. 

### Technology Stack. 

- **React JS**: Main Library used to create the App. 
- **CSS Modules**: Every Component has its own styling module. 
- **SASS**: All styling is written in  the *scss* syntax.
- **React Router**. 
- **React-medium-image-zoom**: External Library for zooming images. 
- **Gh-pages**: Hosting service used for deployment. 

### Features. 

- **Responsiveness**: Built with adaptability in mind, this page can be used in every common screen size. Ranging from small modern phone screens all the way up to ultra-wide monitors. 
- **Fully animated**: Animations were included all across the site to make navigation and interaction as smooth and inmersive as possible. 
- **Cursor Detailing**: Cursor constantly changes to help the user on its navigation. Not only showing the usual hovering on buttons and links but also giving hints of not so obvious extra faetures included to facilitate navigation. 
- **Navigation**: Ease of use thanks to the addition of several options for interacting with certain key areas. PopUps can be closed, as usual, with the 'X' button, but also with external clicking and pressing `Esc` on the keyboard.  

Overall, this web app is thought with detail and easy of use in mind. 

## Inspiration

Calion Crafting is my own personal brand. I use it mostly as a hobby for creating stuff with my own hands on my freetime. Mostly wood work, forging and some 3D printing. The webpage is made so that I could eventually use it for real world application. In its current state, it has aesthetic elements borrowed from Tolkien's imaginarium and Skyrim. 

## Future Improvements.

- Expansion of catalogue: Isted of a single Products Tab, categories would be added to it.  
- BackEnd:
  --> Inventories
  --> User Accounts
